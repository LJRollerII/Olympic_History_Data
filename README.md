# Synopsis

For this project I will use SQL queries to collect and analyze data on the modern Olympic Games from  Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. The SQL queries will also be used to answer the questions below and create visualizations via dashboard.

*<u>Note</u>*: The Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year up until 1992. After that, they staggered them such that Winter Games occur on a four year cycle starting with 1994, then Summer in 1996, then Winter in 1998, and so on.
